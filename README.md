Snapp! Task

Note: As I've mentioned in the email, my system encountered a problem while performing the task and I couldn't make the
files and tests structured. The version which I'd pushed before the deadline is on a9fd97a(Task Done!) commit.

After repairing my system I spent 30 minutes to make the files and test structured but the logic and the functionality
hasn't been changed.
